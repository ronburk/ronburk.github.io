        Stumbling Around V8

    <p>
        V8 is Google's
        JavaScript engine.
        It is notably used inside of Google's Chrome
        web browser, Node.js, and Electron.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an open-source C++ library,
        V8 could theoretically be used by any
        C++ programming project that wants to embed
        a JavaScript interpreter.
        In practice, however, using V8 is pretty
        non-trivial.
        The documentation is, to be charitable,
        sparse.
        These pages record my efforts to understand
        V8.
        Feel free to let me know what-all I've gotten
        wrong.
        I guess you could do it in the form of an "issue" over
        <a href="https://github.com/ronburk/ronburk.github.io/issues">here</a>
        and that way it would only consume my attention if I'm
        still alive and using github at all.

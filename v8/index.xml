        Stumbling Around V8

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8" title="The official mirror of the V8 Git repository">V8</a>
        is Google's
        JavaScript engine.
        It is notably used inside of Google's Chrome
        web browser, Node.js, and Electron.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an open-source C++ library,
        V8 could theoretically be used by any
        C++ programming project that wants to embed
        a JavaScript interpreter.
        In practice, however, using V8 is pretty
        non-trivial.
        The documentation is, to be charitable,
        sparse.
        These pages record my efforts to understand
        V8.
        Feel free to let me know what-all I've gotten
        wrong.
        I guess you could do it in the form of an "issue" over
        <a href="https://github.com/ronburk/ronburk.github.io/issues">here</a>
        and that way it would only consume my attention if I'm
        still alive and using github at all.

        There are many reasons to giggle while beating your head
        against V8,
        but the top-most reason is the name itself.
        A search engine company names their product "V8".
        As a result, as you try to use Google to locate crucial
        help in using V8,
        you may notice that Google's search results are littered
        with helpful links to version 8 of completely unrelated
        products.
        Possibly there should be an internal Google employee
        class on how to pick names that are, you know,
        easy to locate with Google.

        Platform - interface embedders must supply.

        I found the whole <q>platform</q> thing a reliable source
        of confusion.
        Here, I try to sort out what I think I understand.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the quite large surface of engine internals
        V8 exposes in <code>v8.h</code>,
        the V8 <q>platform</q> seems to be a small potpourri
        of abstract interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>v8.h</code> forward-references a class named
        <code>Platform</code> but does not define it.
        Instead, <code>class Platform</code> is defined
        in <code>v8/include/v8-platform.h</code>.
        If you want to define your own <q>platform</q> class
        instead of using one that Google offers,
        that's the header file you'll need to include.
        Beware: in 2020, there's still code churn going on
        in the platform interface.
        Probably mostly related to scheduling execution of things,
        as background execution of JavaScript in web browsers migrates
        into the standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that although V8 kinda/sorta tries to hold the whole
        platform thing at arms length from the rest of the code,
        supplying some implementation of the abstract
        <code>class Platform</code> is required.
        You're supposed to pass a pointer to a <code>Platform</code>
        to <code>v8::InitializePlatform()</code> before
        initializing V8.

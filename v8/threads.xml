        V8: Single- and Multi-Threaded
    </title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        I like to avoid threads, so I naively hoped that
        V8 did not require them.
        But V8 does require threads
        (uses
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</a>
        to be specific),
        so your V8 application will be multi-threaded.
        You get some control over how many "extra" threads are started,
        but it can't be zeo.
        See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56118604/wanting-to-understand-purpose-and-count-of-v8s-workerthreads">this StackOverflow question</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be clear,
        <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/">ECMAScript</a> is single-threaded,
        so V8's implementation of that language
        is likely to always be as well.
        As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">this overview</a> implies,
        combining a single-threaded interpreted language
        with the ability to hand off I/O bound tasks to the external
        environment is a good compromise.
        The vague idea that JavaScript is "missing" threads is
        misplaced.
        If JavaScript had threads, node.js would never have
        gotten off the ground.
        Protecting the masses of programmers from multi-threading
        is more important than protecting them from memory management.
        As Gordon Bell warns,
        <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BellOnThreads"
           >Parallelism is more difficult to implement than
        anyone imagines</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, since V8 lets you run multiple JavaScript
        engines in the same process,
        you are always free to have more than one
        single-threaded JavaScript environment operating at
        the same time.
        You have to arrange for them to communicate, however,
        if they are sharing the work,
        just like a web browser has to use a clunky
        message-posting mechanism to make
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers" title="Web Workers API">"web workers"</a>
        (background JavaScript "threads") actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The V8 library includes
        <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/libplatform/worker-thread.cc">mild support</a>
        for this.
        But I haven't studied it, so may be deeply confused.

        V8 is a large and complex library that can be built in
        a variety of ways.
        Fortunately, Google gives you tools to help you build V8.
        Unfortunately, Google gives you a shit-ton of tools to help
        you build V8.
        I found getting the build I wanted fairly excruciating.
        I'm sure many people have fewer problems;
        I see some online with similar tales of woe, however.
        My experience may not help you, but it may help me
        remember when I get stuck building V8 again.
    </p>
<p>
        Make sure you have a surprising amount of free disk space
        before you start.
        As
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3787">someone said</a>
        "OUCH 2.3GB to compile 40mb worth of sources?"
        Also make sure you have a surprising amount of free time to
        fiddle with this incase things don't quite go your way.
        As
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3787">someone said</a>
        "all this just to compile one compoent to play around with???
        drug addicts!!!"
        [Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of what kind of drugs
        the V8 developers might be addicted to.]
    </p>
<h1>Google Tools</h1>
<p>
        To get you started, Google has a
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/embed" title="Getting started with embedding V8">guide</a>
        which contains an
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/embed#advanced-guide" title="Advanced Guide">advanced guide</a>.
        The guide hotlinks to various other sources of information.
    </p>
<p>
        One of your tasks when installing V8 might be to decide
        which version of V8 you want.
        Google helpfully explains to us
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/version-numbers" title="V8’s version numbering scheme">V8’s version numbering scheme</a>.
        Eventually you might need to stick with a particular
        version for stability,
        not moving to newer versions without extensively testing your
        code against them.
        In the beginning though,
        you might logically just want the "latest stable."
        You will be delighted to discover this involves going to
        a random appspot.com page, finding the latest stable
        <emph>Chromium</emph> for your platform,
        then finding the V8 verion associated with <emph>that</emph>.
        That's only the start of your journey to discover how
        to check out the latest stable version.
        If you're doing this at 2am, you may begin to giggle.
    </p>
<p>
        One early decision you should make is your tool chain.
        I started out trying to build with g++, but then
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58985987/hello-world-cc-sample-seems-to-leak-memory" title="hello-world.cc sample seems to leak memory">discovered</a>
        the V8 developers apparently use
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" title="Clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM">clang</a>'s
        memory checker
        tools instead of valgrind.
        Thinking, "hell yeah, I'm gonna need a lot of memory checking,"
        I decided to switch to clang.
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=am2PXS60sy8C" title="Apologies to Art Spiegelman">And here my troubles began.</a>
    </p>
<p>
        V8 is a pretty hefty download,
        and includes its own copy of clang.
    </p>
<h1>Simple Install</h1>
<p>
        The default install is just a few commands...
        yet somehow Google manages to spread them across
        more than one web page.
        When it comes to documentation,
        Google sure is good at making search engines.
        Anyway, here's my own notes.
    </p>
<p>
        Because you're not a glutton for punishment,
        you're going to build this thing on Ubuntu
        and just take all the defaults
        (e.g. don't try to get a <emph>particular</emph>
        version of V8). You can do it!
        Create some empty directory, like
        <code>./embedv8</code>
        and <code>cd</code> to it.
        First, download the funky Google "depot tools":
    </p>
<pre><code>
        git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
    </code></pre>
<p>
        They will get put in <code>./depot_tools</code> and you will
        next need to alter your PATH environment variable so executables
        there are available to you
        (and to them when you run them).
    </p>
<pre><code>
        export PATH=${PATH}:${$PWD/depot_tools}
    </code></pre>
<p>
        Now you have ask the depot tools to "update" themselves.
        Why? I haven't the slightest idea and the Google docs
        ain't gonna tell us. But OK.
        Remember, you altered your path so that you can just type
        the name of executables in <code>./depot_tools</code>
        so type this:
    </p>
<pre><code>
        gclient
    </code></pre>
<p>
        On my system, this grinds away silently for quite some time,
        then gives this warning message:
    </p>
<pre><code>
        WARNING: Your metrics.cfg file was invalid or nonexistent. A new one will be created.
    </code></pre>
<p>
        Hmmm, couldn't you easily distinguish an initial install from a mysteriously
        missing config file if you were a PhD programmer working at Google?
        Good question. Keep it to yourself.
        Next (on this particular day, anyway)
        I get a "usage" error message complaining that I've run <code>gclient.py</code>
        without any arguments.
        Why?
        No idea.
        But we must keep blindly following instructions, so onward and upward.
    </p>
<p>
        OK, now we hope the "depot tools" are happy in their new home,
        and maybe we can actually use them.
        So you create a directory for checking out V8,
        <code>cd</code> into it,
        and run the depot tools command called <code>fetch v8</code>.
    </p>
<pre><code>
        mkdir v8
        cd v8
        fetch v8
        cd v8
    </code></pre>
<p>
        After some grinding away, you have a copy of V8.
        If you're using my diretory structure,
        then <code>embedv8</code> has two subdirectories now:
        <code>embedv8/depot_tools</code> and
        <code>embedv8/v8</code>.
        If you ever need to remove everything and start over from scratch,
        you may also want to know that you've incidentally created the
        hidden directory
        <code>embedv8/.cipd</code>
        and the hidden files
        <code>embedv8/.gclient</code> and <code>embedv8/.gclient??</code>.
    </p>
<p>
        The
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/source-code" title="Checking out the V8 source code">instructions</a>
        tell you that
        <q>you’re intentionally in a detached head state</q>.
        The practical effect being, I guess(?), that you have to type
        <code>git fetch</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>
        to bring down V8 updates.
        But really, you're not sure exactly what version of V8 you got anyway,
        and you have no idea if you're going to ever get any code working with V8
        or just give up after trying,
        so you can pretty safely ignore this issue for now.
    </p>
<p>
        Now you've successfully got a git repository (<code>embedv8/v8</code>)
        with some unknown version of V8.
        <q>All</q> that's left to do is build it!
        It's time to turn the page in the
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs">Google V8 documentation</a>
        to
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build-gn">Building with GN</a>.
        As you might expect, that means you're going to be using
        yet another tool, this one called <code>gn</code>.
        As you might not expect, it means you might instead
        (or in addition!) use a tool called <code>gm</code>.
    </p>
<h1> The Easy Build</h1>
<p>
        Recall that I'm assuming V8 has been installed in
        <code>embedv8/v8</code>.
        In that case, there's a tool for what Google calls
        <q>the convenience workflow</q> in
        <code>embedv8/v8/tools/dev/gm.py</code>.
        If you alias it in your shell, as Google recommends (e.g.):
        <pre><code>
            alias gm=${PWD}/v8/tools/dev/gm.py
        </code></pre>
        Then the next step is to invoke it with the name of
        one of the <q>known configurations.</q>
    </p>
<p>
        What exactly are the <q>known configurations</q> you can
        ask <code>gm</code> to build?
        Well, <code>gm</code> is actually using another tool under
        the covers, and <emph>that</emph> tool can tell you the
        list of known configurations. Like so (keep making aliases for yourself):
        <pre><code>
            embedv8/v8/tools/dev/v8gen.py list
        </code></pre>
        On this particular day, <code>v8gen.py</code> claims to know
        these configuration names:
    </p>
<pre>
        android.arm.debug
        android.arm.optdebug
        android.arm.release
        arm.debug
        arm.optdebug
        arm.release
        arm64.debug
        arm64.optdebug
        arm64.release
        ia32.debug
        ia32.optdebug
        ia32.release
        mips64el.debug
        mips64el.optdebug
        mips64el.release
        mipsel.debug
        mipsel.optdebug
        mipsel.release
        ppc64.debug
        ppc64.debug.sim
        ppc64.optdebug
        ppc64.optdebug.sim
        ppc64.release
        ppc64.release.sim
        s390x.debug
        s390x.debug.sim
        s390x.optdebug
        s390x.optdebug.sim
        s390x.release
        s390x.release.sim
        x64.debug
        x64.optdebug
        x64.release
        x64.release.sample
    </pre>
<p>
        I'm building and running on an x64 machine,
        and I certainly would like any help possible debugging,
        so my guess is I should use the configuration
        <q>x64.debug</q>.
        So, I type:
        <pre><code>
            gm x64.debug
        </code></pre>
        Oooops! Make sure you run that command while in the top level
        directory of your V8 check out.
        In the example I'm following here, that means:
        <pre><code>
            cd embedv8/v8
            gm x64.debug
        </code></pre>
        And then stand back, and wait.
        Takes a while to do all o' that there buildin'.
        And then, voila!, you have built V8!
    </p>
<h1>What Exactly Did You Build?</h1>
<p>
        Of course, to actually write code that <emph>works with</emph>
        the V8 library you just built,
        you're going to need a little bit of information.
        Let's start at the top: what compiler was used to build
        your V8 library?
        The answer is:  yeah, I don't know.
        Your V8 checkout includes a clang compiler
        (told you to have lots of disk space),
        and you probably have g++ installed,
        so I bet it's one of those two.
    </p>
<p>
        <code>gm</code> kindly gives some tantalizing hints about what has gone on
        when it runs:
        <pre>
            # mkdir -p out/x64.debug
            # echo &gt; out/x64.debug/args.gn &lt;&lt; EOF
            is_component_build = true
            is_debug = true
            symbol_level = 2
            target_cpu = "x64"
            use_goma = false
            goma_dir = "None"
            v8_enable_backtrace = true
            v8_enable_fast_mksnapshot = true
            v8_enable_slow_dchecks = true
            v8_optimized_debug = false
            EOF
        </pre>
        Do you see <q>clang</q> or <q>g++</q> in there?
        Me neither.
        We must, alas, learn more arbitrary stuff that will
        not make us a better person at all.
    </p>
<p>
        Under the covers, <code>gm</code> is using the lower-level tool
        called <code>gn</code>.
        <code>gn</code> can tell you what options were used with a particular
        build of V8.
        Keep in mind stuff (relative to directory structure my examples are using):
        First, you should be in <code>embedv8/v8</code> to run
        these V8 build tools that all reside in
        <code>embedv8/v8/tools/dev</code>
        (alias them all, add it to your PATH, whatever floats your bash).
        Second, to support different side-by-side builds, the V8 build tools
        will need to put each build in a different output directory tree;
        for example, a build of the <q>known configuration</q> called
        <q>x64.release</q> will be stored in the directory named:
        <code>embedv8/v8/out/x64.release</code>.
        Third, it is nearly logical then that the V8 build tools
        will often want to know which build you are referring to
        (which is maddening if you only ever have one, of course),
        so you can expect to have to supply command-line arguments
        like <q>out/x64.release</q>.
    </p>
<p>
        Recall, if you can remember that far back, what we were trying to do:
        figure out exactly how the V8 library configuration named
        <q>x64.release</q> was actually built, so we can
        write C++ code that successfully links with it.
        Turns out that <code>gn</code> records what options
        it used on a given build, and can inform us of them.
        It does this via the <q>args</q> command.
        If you type:
        <pre><code>
            gn args out/x64.release
        </code></pre>
        it will open up an editor (which probably isn't your favorite editor,
        so make sure you know how to exit all 237 editors that Linux supports)
        of a file containing...
        the same output from <code>gm</code> that didn't even tell us
        which damn compiler was used.
        Ha ha! You need a command-line option:
        <pre><code>
            gn args out/x64.release --list
        </code></pre>
        You're going to want to pipe this into <code>less</code> because
        the output is:
        <b>a gajillion possible build options, along with what value they were set to
        in the named build, along with a brief explanation of what they mean</b>.
        Sooo many options, about 50KB.
    </p>
<p>
        So if I search for <q>clang</q> in the resulting spew,
        I find many options I don't care about, but eventually I find this text:
        <pre>
is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:137

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.
        </pre>
        Since the value is <q>true</q>, my build apparently used the clang
        compiler.
        I interpret <q>from the default</q> to mean that there is a giant list
        of default values somewhere that I can't find,
        and the default was not overridden in this build.

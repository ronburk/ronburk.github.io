        V8 is a large and complex library that can be built in
        a variety of ways.
        Fortunately, Google gives you tools to help you build V8.
        Unfortunately, Google gives you a shit-ton of tools to help
        you build V8.
        I found getting the build I wanted fairly excruciating.
        I'm sure many people have fewer problems;
        I see some online with similar tales of woe, however.
        My experience may not help you, but it may help me
        remember when I get stuck building V8 again.
    </p>
<p>
        Make sure you have a surprising amount of free disk space
        before you start.
        As
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3787">someone said</a>
        "OUCH 2.3GB to compile 40mb worth of sources?"
        Also make sure you have a surprising amount of free time to
        fiddle with this in case things don't quite go your way.
        As
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3787">someone said</a>
        "all this just to compile one component to play around with???
        drug addicts!!!"
        [Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of what kind of drugs
        the V8 developers might be addicted to.]
    </p>
<h1>Things to Ponder</h1>
<p>
        To get you started, Google has a
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/embed" title="Getting started with embedding V8">guide</a>
        which contains an
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/embed#advanced-guide" title="Advanced Guide">advanced guide</a>.
        The guide hotlinks to various other sources of information.
    </p>
<p>
        One of your tasks when installing V8 might be to decide
        which version of V8 you want.
        Google helpfully explains to us
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/version-numbers" title="V8’s version numbering scheme">V8’s version numbering scheme</a>.
        Eventually you might need to stick with a particular
        version for stability,
        not moving to newer versions without extensively testing your
        code against them.
        In the beginning though,
        you might logically just want the "latest stable."
        You will be delighted to discover this involves going to
        a random <code>appspot.com</code> page, finding the latest stable
        <em>Chromium</em> for your platform,
        then finding the V8 version associated with <em>that</em>.
        That's only the start of your journey to discover how
        to check out the latest stable version.
        If you're doing this at 2am, you may begin to giggle.
    </p>
<p>
        One early decision you might consider is your tool chain.
        I started out trying to build with g++, but then
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58985987/hello-world-cc-sample-seems-to-leak-memory" title="hello-world.cc sample seems to leak memory">discovered</a>
        the V8 developers apparently use
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" title="Clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM">clang</a>'s
        memory checker
        tools instead of valgrind.
        Thinking, "hell yeah, I'm gonna need a lot of memory checking,"
        I decided to switch to clang.
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=am2PXS60sy8C" title="Apologies to Art Spiegelman">And here my troubles began.</a>
    </p>
<p>
        V8 is a pretty hefty download,
        and includes its own copy of clang.
    </p>
<p>
        Enough pondering. Let's suppose all we want in the world is to get the
        simplest possible C++ program linked with the simplest possible build of the V8 library.
        Let the adventure begin!
    </p>
<h1>Simple Install</h1>
<p>
        The default install is just a few commands...
        yet somehow Google manages to spread them across
        more than one web page.
        When it comes to documentation,
        Google sure is good at making search engines.
        Anyway, here's my own notes.
    </p>
<p>
        Because you're not a glutton for punishment,
        you're going to build this thing on Ubuntu
        and just take all the defaults
        (e.g. don't try to get a <em>particular</em>
        version of V8). You can do it!
        Create some empty directory, like
        <code>./embedv8</code>
        and <code>cd</code> to it.
        First, download the funky Google "depot tools":
    </p>
<code class="block">
        git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
    </code><p>
        They will get put in <code>./depot_tools</code> and you will
        next need to alter your PATH environment variable so executables
        there are available to you
        (and to them when you run them).
    </p>
<code class="block">
        export PATH=${PATH}:${$PWD/depot_tools}
    </code><p>
        Now you must ask the depot tools to "update" themselves.
        Why? I haven't the slightest idea and the Google docs
        ain't gonna tell us. But OK.
        Remember, you altered your path so that you can just type
        the name of executables in <code>./depot_tools</code>
        so type this:
    </p>
<code class="block">
        gclient
    </code><p>
        On my system, this grinds away silently for quite some time,
        then gives this warning message:
    </p>
<code class="block">
        WARNING: Your metrics.cfg file was invalid or nonexistent. A new one will be created.
    </code><p>
        Hmmm, couldn't you easily distinguish an initial install from a mysteriously
        missing config file if you were a PhD programmer working at Google?
        Good question. Keep it to yourself.
        Next (on this particular day, anyway)
        I get a "usage" error message complaining that I've run <code>gclient.py</code>
        without any arguments.
        Why?
        No idea.
        But we must keep blindly following instructions, so onward and upward.
    </p>
<p>
        OK, now we hope the "depot tools" are happy in their new home,
        and maybe we can actually use them.
        So you create a directory for checking out V8,
        <code>cd</code> into it,
        and run the depot tools command called <code>fetch v8</code>.
    </p>
<code class="block">
        mkdir v8
        cd v8
        fetch v8
        cd v8
    </code><p>
        After some grinding away, you have a copy of V8.
         If you're using my directory structure,
        then <code>embedv8</code> has two subdirectories now:
        <code>embedv8/depot_tools</code> and
        <code>embedv8/v8</code>.
        If you ever need to remove everything and start over from scratch,
        you may also want to know that you've incidentally created the
        hidden directory
        <code>embedv8/.cipd</code>
        and the hidden files
        <code>embedv8/.gclient</code> and <code>embedv8/.gclient_entries</code>.
    </p>
<p>
        The
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/source-code" title="Checking out the V8 source code">instructions</a>
        tell you that
        <q>you’re intentionally in a detached head state</q>.
        The practical effect being, I guess(?), that you have to type
        <code>git fetch</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>
        to bring down V8 updates.
        But really, you're not sure exactly what version of V8 you got anyway,
        and you have no idea if you're going to ever get any code working with V8
        or just give up after trying,
        so you can pretty safely ignore this issue for now.
    </p>
<p>
        Now you've successfully got a git repository (<code>embedv8/v8</code>)
        with some unknown version of V8.
        <q>All</q> that's left to do is build it!
        It's time to turn the page in the
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs">Google V8 documentation</a>
        to
        <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build-gn">Building with GN</a>.
        As you might expect, that means you're going to be using
        yet another tool, this one called <code>gn</code>.
        As you might not expect, it means you might instead
        (or in addition!) use a tool called <code>gm</code>.
    </p>
<h1> The Easy Build</h1>
<p>
        Recall that I'm assuming V8 has been installed in
        <code>embedv8/v8</code>.
        In that case, there's a tool for what Google calls
        <q>the convenience workflow</q> in
        <code>embedv8/v8/tools/dev/gm.py</code>.
        If you alias it in your shell, as Google recommends (e.g.):
    </p>
<code class="block">
            alias gm=${PWD}/v8/tools/dev/gm.py
        </code><p>
        Then the next step is to invoke it with the name of
        one of the <q>known configurations.</q>
    </p>
<p>
        What exactly are the <q>known configurations</q> you can
        ask <code>gm</code> to build?
        Well, <code>gm</code> is actually using another tool under
        the covers, and <em>that</em> tool can tell you the
        list of known configurations. Like so (keep making aliases for yourself):
    </p>
<code class="block">
            embedv8/v8/tools/dev/v8gen.py list
        </code><p>
        On this particular day, <code>v8gen.py</code> claims to know
        these configuration names:
    </p>
<pre>
        android.arm.debug
        android.arm.optdebug
        android.arm.release
        arm.debug
        arm.optdebug
        arm.release
        arm64.debug
        arm64.optdebug
        arm64.release
        ia32.debug
        ia32.optdebug
        ia32.release
        mips64el.debug
        mips64el.optdebug
        mips64el.release
        mipsel.debug
        mipsel.optdebug
        mipsel.release
        ppc64.debug
        ppc64.debug.sim
        ppc64.optdebug
        ppc64.optdebug.sim
        ppc64.release
        ppc64.release.sim
        s390x.debug
        s390x.debug.sim
        s390x.optdebug
        s390x.optdebug.sim
        s390x.release
        s390x.release.sim
        x64.debug
        x64.optdebug
        x64.release
        x64.release.sample
    </pre>
<p>
        I'm building and running on an x64 machine,
        and I certainly would like any help possible debugging,
        so my guess is I should use the configuration
        <q>x64.debug</q>.
        So, I type:
        <code class="inline">
            gm x64.debug
        </code>
        Oooops! Make sure you run that command while in the top level
        directory of your V8 check out.
        In the example I'm following here, that means:
        <code class="inline">
            cd embedv8/v8
            gm x64.debug
        </code>
        And then stand back, and wait.
        Takes a while to do all o' that there buildin'.
        And then, voila!, you have built V8!
    </p>
<h1>What Exactly Did You Build?</h1>
<p>
        Of course, to actually write code that <em>works with</em>
        the V8 library you just built,
        you're going to need a little bit of information.
        Let's start at the top: what compiler was used to build
        your V8 library?
        The answer is:  yeah, I don't know.
        Your V8 checkout includes a clang compiler
        (told you to have lots of disk space),
        and you probably have g++ installed,
        so I bet it's one of those two.
    </p>
<p>
        <code>gm</code> kindly gives some tantalizing hints about what has gone on
        when it runs:
        <code class="inline">
            # mkdir -p out/x64.debug
            # echo &gt; out/x64.debug/args.gn &lt;&lt; EOF
            is_component_build = true
            is_debug = true
            symbol_level = 2
            target_cpu = "x64"
            use_goma = false
            goma_dir = "None"
            v8_enable_backtrace = true
            v8_enable_fast_mksnapshot = true
            v8_enable_slow_dchecks = true
            v8_optimized_debug = false
            EOF
        </code>
        Do you see <q>clang</q> or <q>g++</q> in there?
        Me neither.
        We must, alas, learn more arbitrary stuff that will
        not make us better programmers at all.
    </p>
<p>
        Under the covers, <code>gm</code> is using the lower-level tool
        called <code>gn</code>.
        <code>gn</code> can tell you what options were used with a particular
        build of V8.
        Keep in mind some stuff (relative to the directory structure my examples are using):
    </p>
<ul>
        <li>
            First, you should be in <code>embedv8/v8</code> to run
            these V8 build tools that all reside in
            <code>embedv8/v8/tools/dev</code>
            (alias them all, add it to your PATH, whatever floats your bash).
        </li>
        <li>
            Second, to support different side-by-side builds, the V8 build tools
            will need to put each build in a different output directory tree;
            for example, a build of the <q>known configuration</q> called
            <q>x64.release</q> will be stored in the directory named:
            <code>embedv8/v8/out/x64.release</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Third, it is nearly logical then that the V8 build tools
            will often want to know which build you are referring to
            (which is maddening if you only ever have one, of course),
            so you can expect to have to supply command-line arguments
            like <q>out/x64.release</q>.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
        Recall, if you can remember that far back, what we were trying to do:
        figure out exactly how the V8 library configuration named
        <q>x64.release</q> was actually built, so we can
        write C++ code that successfully links with it.
        Turns out that <code>gn</code> records what options
        it used on a given build, and can inform us of them.
        It does this via the <q>args</q> command.
        If you type:
        <pre><code>
            gn args out/x64.release
        </code></pre>
        it will open up an editor (which probably isn't your favorite editor,
        so make sure you know how to exit all 237 editors that Linux supports)
        of a file containing...
        the same output from <code>gm</code> that didn't even tell us
        which damn compiler was used.
        Ha ha! You need a command-line option:
        <pre><code>
            gn args out/x64.release --list
        </code></pre>
        You're going to want to pipe this into <code>less</code> because
        the output is:
        <b>a gajillion possible build options, along with what value they were set to
        in the named build, along with a brief explanation of what they mean</b>.
        Sooo many options, about 50KB.
    </p>
<p>
        So if I search for <q>clang</q> in the resulting spew,
        I find many options I don't care about, but eventually I find this text:
        <pre>
is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:137

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.
        </pre>
        Since the value is <q>true</q>, my build apparently used the clang
        compiler.
        I interpret <q>from the default</q> to mean that there is a giant list
        of default values somewhere that I can't find,
        and the default was not overridden in this build.
    </p>
<p>
        Remember, V8 installed its own clang compiler and that's the one it used.
        So even if you have your own clang installed,
        better play it safe and use the one that built your V8 library.
        If you want to end up with a <code>Makefile</code> like I do,
        you'll need to know that C++ compiler lives at:
        <code class="inline">
            embedv8/v8/third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/bin/clang++
        </code>
    </p>
<h1>Where's That Library?</h1>
<p>
        We keep calling V8 a <q>library</q> so the next logical question
        after figuring out what compiler to use is
        <q>exactly where is the library I should link to?</q>
        It's surely either a shared library (<code>.so</code>) or a
        static library (<code>.a</code>), and we know it
        has to be in the output directory of the build, so let's just do a find:
        <code class="inline">
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src$ cd embedv8/v8/out/x64.release/
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src/embedv8/v8/out/x64.release$ find . -iname "*.so"
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src/embedv8/v8/out/x64.release$ 
        </code>
        OK, there's no shared library of any kind, so try a static library:
        <code class="inline">
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src/embedv8/v8/out/x64.release$ find . -iname "*.a"
./obj/third_party/zlib/libchrome_zlib.a
./obj/third_party/icu/libicuuc.a
./obj/third_party/icu/libicui18n.a
./obj/libv8_libplatform.a
./obj/libv8_libbase.a
        </code>
        The <code>third_party</code> libraries surely ain't it, so we have
        <code>libv8_libplatform.a</code> and <code>libv8_libbase.a</code>.
        I have a bad feeling about this, so let's look at them closer:
        <code class="inline">
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src/embedv8/v8/out/x64.release$ cd obj
ronburk@ronburk-OptiPlex-9020:~/src/embedv8/v8/out/x64.release/obj$ ls -al *.a
-rw-r--r-- 1 ronburk ronburk 24208 Dec 10 16:13 libv8_libbase.a
-rw-r--r-- 1 ronburk ronburk 23262 Dec 10 16:13 libv8_libplatform.a
        </code>
        Yeah, those aren't nearly big enough to contain the huge V8 codebase.
        Against all expectation, the build configuration instructions
        sold to us as easy/default do not actually
        build a V8 library for us to link against!
    </p>
<p>
        This stumped me for a while. Then I realized that the V8 build comes
        with tests and sample programs and asked myself
        <q>Well, how in the hell are they linking?</q>
        After tedious poking around, I concluded what I found difficult to believe was true:
        <b>they statically link with all the individual V8 object files.</b>
    </p>
<h1>Customizing the Build</h1>
<p>
        By now, I had spent days on what I expected to take an hour or two.
        With so much invested, I wasn't about to give up now,
        so I grit my teeth and decided not to quit until I had V8 in
        a library that I could build against with a simple <code>Makefile</code>.
        My goal was a single static library (<code>.a</code>) with debug
        symbols that I could easily link against.
        I eventually ended up with this set of build options:
        <code class="inline">
    "is_lsan=true"
    "is_asan=true"
    "is_debug=true"
    'target_cpu="x64"'
    "is_component_build=false"
    "v8_monolithic=true"
    "v8_use_external_startup_data=true"
    "is_clang=true"
        </code>
        The intent was to get clang debugging features <q>LeakSanitizer</q> and
        <q>AddressSanitizer</q> enabled,
        debugging symbols included, and everything put into a single library
        (which isn't quite possible, because <q>libplatform</q> is for some
        reason treated as not quite a part of the V8 library, even though
        many applications that embed V8 will want it).
    </p>
<p>
        The <q>v8_use_external_startup_data</q> option I believe constructs
        two <code>.bin</code> files containing pre-constructed work that V8
        can load at startup to save time.
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38048888/how-to-build-v8-without-external-startup-data">This page</a> claims V8 startup is now dramatically worse without them,
        so I enabled this option.
        <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots">This V8 blog post</a>
        says you can even build your own customized startup snapshot binaries.
        The Electron team
        <a href="https://blog.atom.io/2017/04/18/improving-startup-time.html">found
        this non-trivial</a>.
    </p>
<p>
        And, even though you want the build option <code>v8_monolithic=true</code>
        if you're trying to get V8 into one big static library,
        the build tool forbids you to combine that with
        <code>v8_use_external_startup_data=true</code>
        because
        <q> Using external startup data would produce separate files.</q>
        Hmmm.
    </p>
<p>
        I called my custom configuration simply <q>debug</q> and stored
        it in the <code>embedv8/v8/out/debug</code> directory.
        To get a custom build using the above build flags required these commands:
        <code class="inline">
            cd embedv8/v8
            gn gen out/debug --args="... insert build flags here..."
            ninja -C out/debug
        </code>
        Obviously, you have to insert the list of build flags in the right place
        and get all the shell quoting right.
        And (sigh) the tool has its own quoting demands;
        for example, it seems to get upset if the
        <code>--args</code> string contains
        <code>target_cpu=x64</code> instead of 
        <code>target_cpu="x64"</code>.
        Of course, I use a script instead of trying this by hand.
    </p>
<h1>A V8 Install/Build Script</h1>
<p>
        To have a reproducible process, all the choices discussed so far
        (and some to come)
        are captured in a script named
        <a href="https://github.com/ronburk/embedv8/blob/master/src/initv8.sh">initv8.sh</a>
        that I store in <code>embedv8/src/initv8.sh</code>.
        This script can be invoked one of two ways.
        When invoked as:
        <code class="inline">
            cd embedv8
            bash src/initv8.sh
        </code>
        it performs a complete install and build of <code>depot_tools</code> and
        V8.
        When invoked as:
        <code class="inline">
            cd embedv8
            . src/initv8.sh
        </code>
        it merely modifies the bash environment.
        To wit, it adds the depot tools to your PATH and
        creates bash aliases for things like the <code>gm</code> and <code>gn</code> commands.
